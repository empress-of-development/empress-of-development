## 🚀 Plot Twist: I build apps now

After spending years in Machine Learning and CV, I had an epiphany: powerful models are useless if they aren't in the user's pocket. Currently, I am channeling my ML background into Android Development to solve a real-world "pain point" - helping people take aesthetically pleasing photos in real-time.

## 📸 Featured Project: PreciosAI 💎

*"Preciosa" is my favorite word in Spanish. It means "precious", and that’s exactly what every person who (I hope) will use my application is.*

My primary focus right now is this Android application (check it out in my pinned repos!).

* **The Problem:** We've all been there - not knowing where to put our hands or how to frame a shot.
* **The Solution:** A smart camera assistant that uses Pose Estimation and Composition Rules to guide users to the perfect shot.
* **The Tech:** Dart, Kotlin, CameraX, Google LiteRT, PyTorch ExecuTorch.
